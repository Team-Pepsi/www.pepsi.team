the pepsipack is a modpack made for the team pepsi cubic chunks server, aka team pepsi modded server.

to join, simply run the launcher, launch the pepsipack, and go to the multiplayer tab! the server will be added automagically.

download the launcher [here](/misc/pepsipackLauncher-0.0.1.jar)

if you get errors while running it, you should make sure you have the [latest version of java 8 installed](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html)

it won't affect your normal launcher, data is installed to the .pepsilauncher/instances directory instead of .minecraft.

if you are a l33t h4x0r you should try using it with [pepsimod](https://github.com/Team-Pepsi/pepsimod/releases)
