the pepsi pack is a cool pack

you can use it to connect to the mod area on our cool minecraft server, mc.pepsi.team

it's very good and also nice

download the launcher [here](/misc/pepsipackLauncher-0.0.1.jar)

if you are a l33t h4x0r you should try using it with [pepsimod](https://github.com/Team-Pepsi/pepsimod/releases)
