the pepsipack is a modpack made for the [team pepsi cubic chunks server](http://www.pepsi.team/server), aka team pepsi modded server.

to join, simply run the launcher, launch the pepsipack, and go to the multiplayer tab! the server will be added automagically.

## using the launcher

download the launcher [here](/misc/pepsipackLauncher-0.0.1.jar)

if you get errors while running it, you should make sure you have the [latest version of java 8 installed](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html)

it won't affect your normal launcher, data is installed to the .pepsilauncher/instances directory instead of .minecraft.

## not using the launcher

if you don't want to use the team pepsi launcher then you can go to [my cloud](http://cloud.daporkchop.net/modpackRepo/noLauncher/pepsipack/) and download all the relevant files into your .minecraft folder

you'll need at least forge 1.12.2-14.23.1.2556 to run the pack

## shameless plug

if you are a l33t h4x0r you should try using it with [pepsimod](https://github.com/Team-Pepsi/pepsimod/releases)
