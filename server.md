# subservers

### bedwars

not normal bedwars, this is torogadude's take on bedwars

i literally took the bedwars plugin i made for torogadude's server and put it on my own server and there you go

### anarchy skyblock

skyblock with no rules, i don't think anything else needs to be said

### the hallway

anarchy with the cubic chunks mod and amazing terrain

additionally, i've constrained it on the Z axis so the world is 30,000,000 blocksx256 blocks horizintally and 1,073,741,824 blocks tall

ores generate equally frequently at all heights, and the end is at y=16,000 (instead of being a different dimension)

requires the [hallway modpack](http://www.pepsi.team/hallway) to join

### modded

not yet in existance

### hub

a hub

featuring cool pepsi flooring
